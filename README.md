# Android Ingress Intel App
This app is intended to facilitate mapping Portals into a custom map layer for Ingress players. It does not interact with the Ingress game in any way. The app provides a method of recording notes and later viewing the notes as well as locations within a cutom map overlay.
A fusion table is used to save the information common to a number of players, as well as generate the overlay.

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/wokstok/ingressintel/issues) section
